basic distance monitor i made years ago using ultrasonic sensor

#IMPORTANT NOTES

LCD contrast is fixed by connecting V0 directly to GND
Display contrast may be strong or light depending on LCD module
All GND pins must be common
Use 220 ohm resistor for LCD backlight safety

- LCD is used without a potentiometer
- LCD contrast (V0) is connected directly to GND
- All GND pins must be common (LCD, sensor, Arduino)
- Use a 220 ohm resistor for LCD backlight safety
- If LCD shows nothing, check contrast and wiring
- Ultrasonic sensor works best indoors
- Keep sensor straight for accurate distance
- Compatible with Arduino UNO
